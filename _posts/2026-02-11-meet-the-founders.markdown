Living Room Productions started in 2024 when Lewis got a voucher for a sketch writing course. After a few weeks of writing and editing pieces, he wrote a commercial parody sketch. The sketch was an ad for furniture that assembles itself. The idea was that, throughout the ad, it would become increasingly clear that the furniture was alive. He wanted it to be creepy, and it was, but it wasn't creepy **enough**. So, he called his best friend Tristan for a punch-up.

Tristan read the script and tossed out some ideas. "Add a hyena," he said, correctly. "Cut the narration for the last page, really let them sit with the silence." Again, a good choice. Most importantly, Tristan pitched a name for the sketch: **Living Room.**

After that, Lewis and Tristan got into a groove as writers. They were pitching, writing, and editing as a team. In the summer of 2024, they decided to write a feature length script together. In 2026, they'll be co-directing that script at the Montreal Fringe Festival.
